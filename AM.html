    <h3> I am 15 years old. I love Mathematics and Science, espically anytype of matrix and vectors. I am a STEM learner that was inspired by some parts of nature. Patrs of New Jeresy that I traveled, face mutiple warming distators. Imagine yourself living in an environment where you were to be harmed to the enviorment. No claen water, and wildfires starting around yourself.  Humans have Extrabated the Earth for coal and oil. As I grow older, I am inspired to be a General Suregon or work in the Biotech industry to give back to my environment. I am a BAM mentee at Microsoft and I'm getting started into networking, I have presnted my idea with Chris Cap, we now have an idea of how this soultion will be allocated.</h4>
